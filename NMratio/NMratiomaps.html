    <h1 style="color:red">New Mexico Poverty Data by Race and Origin </h1>
    
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <h3>One of the interesting things about working with Census Data is that you learn about the shortcomings of survey data. While North Carolina happens to have fairly robust survey data reported, New Mexico does not. If this poses a practical issue in terms of rendering data visible, it also offers a theoretical ground for an important point. The lack of representation itself calls attention to the nature of reported data, its source, and the limitations of this medium. As my maps show, we are only visualizing a fraction of the story. Some areas of New Mexico were not surveyed or received inadequate responses because of low population density. All this tells us is what we already know -- survey data is biased toward spaces with more people and hence more data points. </h3>
    <h3>As each of these three ratio maps show, there are some ambiguities about identity when reporting poverty data. My map for the previous assignment simply feature the total number of individuals in poverty. I was curious about more specific data and the limitations of the data set I was working with. We can see from the titles of each section that individuals were allowed to self report their identity according to a number of categories. The two axes in New Mexico that had signficant reportage included race and whether one was of Hispanic or Latino Origin. I have shown these three respective maps to render visible some inconsistencies in poverty distribution according to race and origin.</h3>
   
    <h2>Any race of Hispanic or Latino Origin:</h2>
    <p>The particular categories may generally speak for themselves. We can see that there is a greater percentage of those of in poverty of any race of Hispanic or Latino Origin in the southern counties of New Mexico. </p>

    </a>
    <h2>White of any Origin:</h2>
    <p> We can see that this category encompasses the largest percent population of individuals in poverty with the greatest concentration of cases in the south east corner of the state. In the case of three counties, this identity category comprises over 85% of the reported cases of poverty.</p>

    <h2>White Alone:</h2>
    <p>This racial and ethnic category comprised the smallest portion of reported poverty cases of the three categories displayed. In part, we can see that it is a more selective criteria in comparison to the previous combination of white race and any ethnicity. This map paired with the prior one may provide the most useful visual exposition of the three maps shown. Between the two maps, we can come to understand that white citizens, not of Hispanic or Latino origin, comprised more significant portions of white citizens of any race, in the centralmost southern county shown. Similarly, they comprised large portions of the population in northwestern counties. While this is hardly conclusive or statistically sound evidence, it offers an initial insight and may offer grounds to conduct further research. </p>

    <h2></u>Afterthoughts:</h2>
    <h3>As I have already implied, I found this sort of analysis awkward and limited. Indeed, the language or reasoning behind this sort of identity reportage seemed equally ambiguous on the census questionaire itself. The simultaneous self-identification of race and ethnic origin may well have confused those surveyed. Or, it may offer a useful grid of categories for anyone hoping to conduct a thorough analysis of relations between race, ethnicity, and economic situation. </h3>
