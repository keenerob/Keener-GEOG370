    <h1 style="color:red">North Carolina Annual Median Air Quality Index per County for the year 2020 </h1>
    
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <h3>This choropleth map displays EPA data regarding the Air Quality Index. As I have noted on the map itself, this index is a metric reflecting simultaneous counts of the five major air pollutants. If North Carolina were threatened by fires like western states, isolating one variable such as partical pollution could be more useful. I was interested in seeing if any parts of North Carolina had an especially high median index, which would indicate a significant number of high AQI days and thus suggest further cause for inquiry. I had hoped to add a pie chart reflecting the individual counts of each respective major pollutant, at each test site, but this data was less widely available. As can be seen, even North Carolina has a limited number of air quality test sites. From this data shown, we can see that all of North Carolina's counties fall in the healthy range for median AQI (below 50) although several outlying counties had a relatively high average AQI for the year 2020. All of that being said, one might further inquire into the number of high AQI and thus 'Low Air Quality' days in each county and specifically those with high medians. This would be another useful way of rendering a similar if adjacent data set. </h3>
