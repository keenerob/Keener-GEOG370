    <h1> Homework7:Census Data Chloropleth</h1>
    <h2> Robert Keener</h2> 
    <h3> I have spent some time in New Mexico and I was curious about what sort of statewide data might be available. As it turned out, there was not a lot. I decided to depict poverty per county on this map out of curiosity. Once I realized that many of New Mexico's more rural counties had not been surveyed, I was unsure if I should continue. I felt that, in fact, to depict the limited array of counties surveyed is also useful, if for more epistemological reasons. Here we can see the different levels of poverty in New Mexico, as well as the areas where the census did not survey or at least represent their findings. At the very least, it can be said that rural communities are easily overlooked by such a broad representation. </h2>
